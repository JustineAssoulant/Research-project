Visualization and distance computation in SE(3): Application to structural bioinformatics

This project was carried out as part of our studies at INSA Toulouse and supervised by Juan Cortez, Research Director at LAAS-CNRS. 
Each protein has its own roles and functions. They are generally made up of two rigid domains linked by a flexible linker (little studied in the past).
The aim of our project was to create a method for visualising the position of one of the two rigid domains relative to the other. 
This makes it possible to study the flexibility of the linker and learn more about its properties.
